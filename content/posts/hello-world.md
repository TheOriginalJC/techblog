Introduction
------------
Welcome.
I've wanted to write this for a while. Thankfully no one was waiting around desperate to read it as it probably wouldn't be worth the wait. I can't guarantee there won't be any future disapointment though.

The first thing I want to do is answer the question "Why even bother?"

Answer. Primarily for educational purposes.

The act of learning new things well enough to write about them is far more effective than simply reading and hoping enough sticks, as demonstrated below.

STICKY HOMUNCULUS

The various models of learning created by educational psychologists suggests they might agree. If we focus on just one model, Blooms Taxonomy, and look at how the closer you get to the top, the dirtier your hands get (sadly "the closer you get to the top, the dirtier your hands get" sounds like a motto for politicians).

Although it was probably never intended to be interpreted in such a way, there is an implied start and end point. In reality, I suspect the most successful learners bounce around a bit, starting at the bottom and working their way up, then going back and working on weaker area's, building a more complete knowledge set each time.

It might make more sense if the model was a circle, or a set of fully connected nodes, but when we look at other models of learning, it appears educational psychologists just love their triangles.

What does this have to do with anything?

I wouldn't want to follow such a system with complete rigidity, but if we look at the process of creating this blog, it probably went something like this - 

I already had some knowlege relating to the goal, so I had to remember enough about hosting environments to pick the right one for my needs (that means "the cheapest I can use with the least hassle").

I quickly settled on Azure static sites, and I understood enough about static site generators to decide I wanted to use an SSG rather than hand code all the html and deal with all the hassle of updating it.  However, I didn't know enough to feel comfortable picking an SSG to use. This required a step back and some research, mostly on jamstack, and with a little play around writting my own SSG in python.

This part of the project was a bit of a loop around the bottom of the triangle, reading about (and remembering) different SSG's and or the neccessary parts of Python I was unfamiliar with. I had to understand each of those things enough to apply that knowledge and cobble together little prototypes.

Eventually, with enough familiarity of the different frameworks and a basic one of my own, I was able to analyse the benefits and difficulties presented by each approach, and evaluate each against the other in relation to my requirements.

This is a heavily condensed recollection to keep things concise. I also had to think about source control and deployment, although these decisions were more a case of "I want to learn more about x so lets use it".
